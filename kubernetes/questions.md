1.  In the example deployment file, what is the total number of containers that will be created?
2.  What would you change to increase the number of pods created in our example deployment?
3.  What command is needed to deploy the example manifest?
4.  How would check `container1` logs on any of the running pods.  (Note: For this question, you can assume the pods are running in the example namespace)
5.  What is the process needed to check the environment variables on `container2`? (Note: For this question, you can assume the pods are running in the example namespace)
