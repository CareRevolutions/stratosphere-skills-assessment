1. You suspect a DDOS attack is currently taking place and youâ€™d like to mitigate it quickly.  Your application public-server log, server.log, in JSON format, records elements ClientSourceIP, RequestString, UnixEpochSeconds. Write a one-line (preferably) utility that displays either (your choice) a histogram of the top 100 client IPs in the last 10 seconds, every 10 seconds, or a histogram of the top 100 client IPs of the last 100,000 requests, roughly every 100,000 requests.
