1. Suppose the security officer imposes the requirement that all actions that affect the production environment must be performed collaboratively by no fewer that two people (kind of like the firing of nuclear missiles purportedly requires simultaneous turning of two keys...)  Outline a way of accomplishing this (the scope can be limited, for example, to AWS -GUI or -CLI commands, or shell based (bundle/mvn/heroku/etc.) deployments) considering a 100% remote workforce.  In addition to the answer scoring criteria outlined above, simplicity is of major consideration here.
2. The Analytics team is asking for some production data to be added to the data warehouse, namely a customer table that has names and social security numbers (“SSN”).  They wish to associate statistics of signed documents recorded in another table with user details in the proposed table, and the common element between the tables is SSN.  The work ticket notes supplied by the Analytics manager say that the implementer (i.e. you) should obfuscate the personal information by replacing the SSNs with sha-256 hashes of the SSN.  How would you approach this ticket?  What issues and recommendations would you bring up, if any, before you implemented it?  Explore this from all sides --  technical, security, diplomacy, etc.
