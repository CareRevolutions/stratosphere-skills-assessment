For a simple LB, ap, db stack design a network policy, ideally either AWS Security Group, or k8s NetworkPolicy (others are accepted). 

We are looking for 
* locking down communication between backend resources
* allowing access to LB from internet or a set or restricted IPs
* ipv6 rules if applicable
